## 👩‍💻 About Me

🎓 I’m a Software Engineer.

💻 I work as a full-stack developer, primarily building projects with technologies like .NET Core, ASP.NET, Flutter, and Vue.js.

🚀 For me, software development isn’t just about writing code — it's about understanding problems, analyzing them, and crafting effective solutions. That’s the part I enjoy the most.

🔍 Errors, bugs, and technical limitations aren’t obstacles for me — they’re opportunities to learn something new.

🛠️ Solving a problem requires more than just technical skills; it demands patience, research ability, and determination — all of which I strive to improve every day.

📌 Whether it's spending hours debugging a complex issue or adapting to a new framework, the journey of software development is like solving a constantly evolving equation. And I’m eager to solve every part of it.
